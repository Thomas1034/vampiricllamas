# Vampiric Llamas

Face bleating horrors from accursed tombs!

## Overview

This Minecraft mod adds vampire llamas, along with useful items crafted from their loot. 

As this is a parody of various melodramatic vampire stereotypes, great liberties were taken with the source material. Despite this, vampire llamas are still meant to be an engaging, challenging, and rewarding encounter.

## Contents

As of the initial release, this mod contains:
- **Vampire Llamas**, minibosses with multiple stages. They will kill and convert other llamas.
- **Llama Graveyards**, small spooky graveyards that generate around the world. Eerie bleating sounds emanate from the center crypt.
- **Vampire Leather** and **Llama Fangs**, obtained from killing **Vampire Llamas**. 
- **Vampire Leather Armor**, an armor set that grants buffs in the dark. The buffs are different for each piece! Try wearing the whole set for a handy bonus effect.
- **Totems of Persistence**, items that work much like **Totems of Undying**; they are crafted from **Vampire Leather**, **Bones**, an **Iron Ingot**, and a **Llama Fang**.
- **Fang Knives**, dagger-like weapons that grant their wielder **Regeneration** and **Hunger** upon striking living foes—exchanging food for even faster regeneration.
- **Vampire Cloaks**, swooping bat wings that act as an early-game glider. Be warned—while they bestow a bat's flight, they also bestow a curse.
